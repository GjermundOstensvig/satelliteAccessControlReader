# satelliteAccessControlReader

This repos is for a lab exercise for Østfold University College. It gives examples for how to solve the code for the RFID reader.
The Arduino sketch was pretty bug, so I have chosen to split it into multiple files. 
The four files listed below should be in the same folder so the Arduino compiler puts them together correctly.
* Access
* ConvertToInt
* IoTRfidEnhet
* QueryToDatabase
